## Moderators for Live module

The live module includes these functionalities :

* Polls
* Quizzes (coming soon)

### Q&A

[How to moderate Q&A](https://github.com/applidget/event-cms-documentation/blob/master/sections/moderators/q_and_a.md)


Q&A is a tool for guests to share a comment, ask a question related to the session. Doing so, the guests will be able to start a debate on the subject and answer to each other.
Q&A can be upvoted by guests :
* Upvoting a Question means that it would be interesting for the speaker to talk about it during the session
* Upvoting an Answer means that the guest agrees with it and wants to highlight it

You can also add a Question from the back-office : click on "Post a question/comment" and specify the content in the form.
After that, you will be able to publish/unpublish the Q&A so the Questions is available or not in the front-office.
When the Q&A is published, a direct link to the public page appears right next to the label.
Click on "Moderate", here you have all the answers given by the guests for this question, as well as the number of upvotes.
