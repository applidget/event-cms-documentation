## Add a comment/question

Guests can create new comment directly on the website (the front-office) but you can also create comments in the backoffice to pre-fill your Q&A module.

Click on 'Create a question/comment' in the backoffice and fill the form with your comment. 
If this comment is enabled, it can be seen on the front office and guests can post answers on it.

## Enable/disable a comment

Guests can freely create new comment in the front office but in certain cases (abuses, off topic, duplicate, …) you will need to hide a comment in the front office.
Click on the link 'disable' for every comment you want to hide. You can display it again by clicking on 'enable'.

## Delete a comment

If you want to hide a comment for good, you can also click on 'disable' and on the red button 'delete' right after.The comment will be removed from the front and the back office.

## Edit a comment

Moderators can edit the content of a comment (e.g. adding some details). Just hit the 'edit' button and modify it.

## Moderate a question/comment

If you want to moderate the debate on a question (see and moderate answers, see the vote counter, …), click on the 'moderate' button.


![Moderate Q&A](https://raw.github.com/applidget/event-cms-documentation/master/images/moderators/qa_moderate_backoffice.png)

On this snapshot, you can see : 

1. Comment/question details : content, creation date, author and status (enabled or not)
2. The vote counter : how many guests have upvoted this comment
3. Answers : the content of each answer and actions available (edit and publish/unpublish)

### Hide an answer

Guests can freely answer to any question displayed on the front office so it will be necessary to moderate an answer if it does not respect the rules. Click on 'unpublish' and the content of this answer will be hidden on the front office. By default, this answer will be replaced by 'This answer has been moderated' (see the 'advanced settings' for details).

### Edit an answer

Like comments, answers can be edited by clicking on the edit button.

![edit session](https://raw.github.com/applidget/event-cms-documentation/master/images/moderators/edit_session.png)

On this page, you can define :

1. The name of your session (e.g. name of the meeting or name of the conference)
2. The status of the comment when a guest create a new one. If it is enable by default, it can be seen directly by all guests. Otherwise, comments have to be validated before publication.
3. This field defined the message displayed on the front-office when an answer has been moderated
