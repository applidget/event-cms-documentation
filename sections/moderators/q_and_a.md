Guests can create new comment directly on the website (the front-office) but you can also create comments in the backoffice to pre-fill your Q&A module.

If this comment is enabled, it can be seen on the front office and guests can post answers on it.

## [](#enable_comment) Enable/disable a comment

Guests can freely create new comment in the front office but in certain cases (abuses, off topic, duplicate, …) you will need to hide a comment in the front office.
Click on the link 'disable' for every comment you want to hide. You can display it again by clicking on 'enable'.

## [](#delete_comment) Delete a comment

If you want to hide a comment for good, you can also click on 'disable' and on the red button 'delete' right after.The comment will be removed from the front and the back office.

## [](#edit_comment) Edit a comment

Moderators can edit the content of a comment (e.g. adding some details). Just hit the 'edit' button and modify it.

## [](#moderate_comment) Moderate a question/comment

On this snapshot, you can see : 

1. Comment/question details : content, creation date, author and status (enable or not)
2. The vote counter : how many guests have upvoted this comment
3. Answers : the content of each answer and actions available (edit and publish/unpublish)

### [](#hide_answer) Hide an answer

Guests can freely answer to any question displayed on the front office so it will be necessary to moderate an answer if it does not respect the rules. Click on 'unpublish' and the content of this answer will be hidden on the front office. By default, this answer will be replaced by 'This answer has been moderated' (see the 'advanced settings' for details).
